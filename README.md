# Data-Analyst-IBM
<p>I am thrilled to have completed the final assignment for my "Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python" course with IBM. Learning SQL as a new programming language was challenging, especially mastering its complexities for effective data manipulation. 
Despite the difficulties, I am pleased with my work and results. To share my journey and findings, I have stored a copy of the files on GitHub as a repository. Feel free to check it out to see my progress and results.</p>
